Pointers in C:

=======================

#include <stdio.h>

Int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
{
Int var = 10;
Int * ip;

Ip = &var;

Printf("Address of Variable is %x\n",&var);
Printf("address of ip is %x\n",ip);
Printf("value of %d\n",*ip);
Return 0;

}

Output: 
Value is 10

=======================

Pointer in CPP:

=======================


#include <iostream>
Using namespace std;

Int main()
{
   int a=10;
   int *p=&a;
   
Cout<<a<<endl;
Cout<<&a<<endl;
Cout<<p<<endl;
Cout<<&p<<endl;
Cout<<*p<<endl;

Return 0;
}


Output:
10

10
=======================

Why Pointers:

 to access heap memory
To access files: file pointer
Cin cout use pointers

Pointer in cpp:


Pointers are used to access heap memory

5 arithmetic operations are allowed on pointers:
	• p++    moves pointer to next element
	• p-- moves pointer to previous element
	• p+k gives address of kth element from pointer to right
	• p-k gives address of kth element from pointer location to left
	• q-p  gives no of elements between 2 pointers p and q
